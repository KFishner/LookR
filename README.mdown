Introduction
================

LookR is an R package that contains functions that interface with the Looker API programmatically—namely LookerSetup and LookerQuery.

Installation
------------

* Clone the LookR repo to your local machine.

* Within the R console (install required packages first)
```R 
install.packages('RCurl')
install.packages('RJSONIO')
install.packages('digest')
install.packages('stringr')
install.packages('bitops')
install.packages('<path to directory containing tar>/LookR_1.0.tar.gz', repos = NULL, type = 'source')
```

Examples
------------

```R
library("LookR")

LookerSetup(
	token = "Jkz9GRYoIhyuJ4498FG89Iz",     	 	         # Not a real token
	secret = "v2+MNxMg1vdmijjYbtBhGDFEQSlAUEZd4xWd",         # Not a real secret
	host = "demo.looker.com", 
	port = 443
)
```

The function ```LookerSetup``` takes ```token, secret, host, and port``` as mandatory arguments. The function stores these values for use in ```LookerQuery```.

```R
df <- LookerQuery(
 	dictionary="thelook", 
 	query="orders", 
 	fields=c("orders.created_month", "orders.count"), 
 	filters=c("orders.created_date: 24 months", "orders.is_first_purchase: Yes")
)

head(df)
```
The function ```LookerQuery``` takes ```dictionary, query, and fields``` as mandatory arguments; ```filters, limit, and output``` are optional arguments. ```Dictionary``` is the name of the database connection in Looker. For more information on Looker database connections, [read the guide](http://www.looker.com/docs/data-modeling/getting-started/connect-to-db-and-generate-model). ```Query``` is the name of the database table you want to query. (Note: filters are passed as a vector of key-value pairs containing the dimension or measure name and the filter language, separated by a colon.) The output options supported are an R data frame or JSON object—the arguments are ```output="data.frame"``` and ```output="json"```, respectively.
